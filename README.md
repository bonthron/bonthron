I'll leave the Wirth repo here, because he's cool... Go find his book.  \
And a ridiculously simple but useful Emacs hack. \


## Emacs View-Kill
[repo](https://github.com/bonthron/view-kill)   \
Emacs customization to "view the kill ring" without a doubt the most useful thing I've ever written in my life. It's short enough to copy and paste in your dot emacs file.   \

## Algorithms + Data Structures 1976

Revisiting Niklaus Wirth's classic book. 45 years later- it remains highly relevant. \
The code examples are Pascal. Amazingly, all the code still compiles unchanged! using the 2020 version of Free Pascal.

In addition to the original Pascal, I'm re-working the algorithms in **Scheme, JavaScript**, and **Python**. \
Hacking Pascal is old school fun !
